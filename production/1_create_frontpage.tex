    \huge Participation Spillover of the National Kidney Registry
\end{center}

\vspace*{0.5in}

\noindent \textbf{Abstract:} This paper provides the first empirical evidence on hospital participation spillover of the National Kidney Registry (NKR), the largest kidney-exchange network in the United States. We use a unique dataset from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to define links between hospitals based on the presence of common surgeons. We find that a hospital with one more NKR connection in the last period is 1.2 to 1.5 times more likely than its no-NKR counterparts to join the NKR. The spillover concentrates among strong connections, measured by the type and the number of common surgeons. In light of the current fragmented kidney-exchange market, our finding sheds light on reducing information friction to promote new participation.
