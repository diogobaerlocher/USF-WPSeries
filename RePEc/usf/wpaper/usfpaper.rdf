Title: Old But Gold: Historical Pathways and Path Dependence
Abstract: Following the discovery of gold in 1694 in Brazil, pathways were constructed to connect coastal settlements to mining regions in the unpopulated interior. While these pathways initially facilitated the creation of road towns, their influence faded by the late nineteenth century. With the mid-twentieth-century demographic and industrial transition, regions with higher historical road density experienced renewed population growth and greater migrant inflows. We argue that this resurgence reflects the role of road towns in fostering early urbanization and structural transformation. Using an extended Rosen-Roback-Glaeser framework, we estimate strong agglomeration spillovers, suggesting that Brazil’s spatial economy exhibits multiple steady states and historical path dependence.

Title: Estimation of Linear Models from Coarsened Observations: A Method of Moments Approach
Abstract: In the last few decades, the study of ordinal data in which the variable of interest is not exactly observed but only known to be in a specific ordinal category has become important. In Psychometrics such variables are analysed under the heading of item response models (IRM). In Econometrics, subjective well-being (SWB) and self-assessed health (SAH) studies, and in Marketing Research, Ordered Probit, Ordered Logit, and Interval Regression models are common research platforms. To emphasize that the problem is not specific to a specific discipline we will use the neutral term coarsened observation. For single-equation models estimation of the latent linear model by Maximum Likelihood (ML) is routine. But, for higher -dimensional multivariate models it is computationally cumbersome as estimation requires the evaluation of multivariate normal distribution functions on a large scale. Our proposed alternative estimation method, based on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), circumvents this multivariate integration problem. The method is based on the assumed zero correlations between explanatory variables and generalized residuals. This is more general than ML but coincides with ML if the error distribution is multivariate normal. It can be implemented by repeated application of standard techniques. GMM provides a simpler and faster approach than the usual ML approach. It is applicable to multiple equation models with K-dimensional error correlation matrices and kJ response categories for the the kth equation. It also yields a simple method to estimate polyserial and polychoric correlations. Comparison of our method with the outcomes of the Stata ML procedure cmp yields estimates that are not statistically different, while estimation by our method requires only a fraction of the computing time.

Title: Finding Home When Disaster Strikes: Dust Bowl Migration and Housing in Los Angeles
Abstract: When natural disasters strike, the impact on housing markets can be far-reaching. This paper explores the unique dynamics of natural disaster-induced migration on the housing market, focusing on the 1930s Dust Bowl migration to Los Angeles---the top migrant destination. We use U.S. Census-linked and geocoded address data to document that the arrival of Dust Bowl migrants significantly impacted the city's housing market. We show that houses inhabited by Dust Bowl migrants had lower price growth over the decade. Critically, we uncover valuation spillovers within highly granular neighborhoods, where houses inhabited by non-migrants experienced lower price growth modulated by how close they were to Dust Bowl migrants. Our analysis of potential mechanisms suggests that these effects were primarily driven by the economic vulnerability of migrants rather than generalized discrimination. Our research contributes to understanding how natural disaster-induced migration shapes housing markets and the dimensions in which climate refugees differ from other migrants.

Title: Boundaries Generate Discontinuities in the Urban Landscape
Abstract: Neighborhood boundaries are often determined by physical topography, transportation networks, or the administration of public goods (e.g., school attendance zones). We present a simple model of boundaries that predicts discontinuities in household demographics, the supply of amenities, and home prices at physical and administrative boundaries. We take these predictions to the data and find abundant evidence of discontinuities in a wide range of observable dimensions – the universe of variables available in the 2020 Census at the Block group level – and six different types of boundaries. We draw two important conclusions from these findings: (1) researchers should implement boundary discontinuity designs with caution because the key identification assumption may not hold except in narrow applications, and (2) even narrowly targeted place-based policies may have much broader impacts if they involve a new administrative boundary.

Title: Licensed Professionals and Corporate Board Performance: The Effect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on the Audit Committee
Abstract: We study the substitution between licensed and unlicensed workers and the quality effect of employing licensed professionals on firms. Leveraging a quasi-licensure mandate of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) on audit committees of publicly-traded firms, this paper studies the employment spillover and quality effects of licensing at the firm level. Assembling multiple data sources, we identify independent directors with relevant licenses and the quality of accounting reports for more than 5,200 publicly-traded firms. Exploiting plausibly exogenous year-by-firm variation in fixed-effect models, the licensure mandate of SOX significantly increases the appointment of certified public accountants (CPAs) at the expense of other types of professionals at the board level. We find a precise zero effect for the presence of CPAs on audit committees on the need to refile financial statements.

Title: Residential Segregation at Physical Neighborhood Boundaries
Abstract: Physical boundaries delineate neighborhoods and are distinguishable from administrative boundaries like school districts and county lines. This paper sheds light on historic railroad placement as a predictor of contemporary segregation by employing a digitized map of Texas railroads circa 1911 to compare census block groups separated by train tracks today. Using a boundary discontinuity design, I first document an unconditional house price premium of 21% to live on the high income side of the tracks. Exploiting distinct variation in race and income demographics at railroad boundaries, I obtain hedonic estimates of the price premium for white population share and income composition. Conditional on differences in school quality and access to private consumption amenities, households are willing to pay up to 16% of home price for the race and income composition available on the high income side of the tracks.

Title: Does the United States Spend Enough on Public Schools?
Abstract: The United States ranks low among peer countries on the ratio of teacher spending to per capita GDP. Is this (in)efficient? Using a spatial equilibrium model we show that spending on schools is efficient if an increase in school spending funded through local taxes would leave house prices unchanged. By exploiting plausibly exogenous shocks to both school spending and taxes, paired with 25 years of national data on local house prices, we find that an exogenous tax-funded increase in school spending would significantly raise house prices. These findings provide causal evidence that teacher spending in the U.S. is inefficiently low.

Title: Teacher Licensing, Teacher Supply, and Student Achievement: Nationwide Implementation of edTPA
Abstract: The recent controversial roll-out of the educative Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) - a performance-based exam - raises the bar of initial teacher licensure and makes teacher recruitment difficult. We leverage the quasi-experimental setting of different adoption timing by states and analyze multiple data sources containing a national sample of prospective teachers and students of new teachers in the US. With extensive controls of concurrent policies, we find that the edTPA reduced prospective teachers in undergraduate programs, less-selective and minority-concentrated universities. Contrary to the policy intention, we do not find evidence that edTPA increased student test scores.

Title: Stay-at-Home Peer Mothers and Gender Norms: Short-run Effects on Educational Outcomes
Abstract: Increased exposure to gender-role information affects a girl's educational performance. Utilizing the classroom randomization in Chinese middle schools, we find that the increased presence of stay-at-home peer mothers significantly reduces a girl's performance in mathematics. This exposure also cultivates gendered attitudes towards mathematics and STEM professions. Long exposure, dense network, and distant parent-daughter relationship enhance peer mothers' influences. As falsification tests against unobserved confounding factors, we find that the exposure to stay-at-home peer mothers does not affect boys' performance, nor do we find that stay-at-home peer fathers affect girls' outcomes.

Title: Effects of Occupational License Access on Undocumented Immigrants: Evidence from the California Reform
Abstract: In 2014, California lifted legal work status requirement for dozens of occupational licenses - a major obstacle for undocumented immigrants in the US to access professional jobs. This paper assesses its effects on the employment outcome of undocumented immigrants in California. Analysing likely undocumented immigrants in the American Community Survey, I find that the law increased their employment, particularly in lower-skill or blue-collar licensed occupations, and older or Hispanic workers. I also find the law did not crowd out documented or domestic workers.

Title: Financial Exclusion and Inflation Costs
Abstract: This paper constructs two models of financial exclusion to assess the welfare costs of inflation. In the first, inflation costs are measured within a classical endowment economy. The second includes a production sector and costly credit. Both models are calibrated to account for inflation costs in a high-inflation economy (developing country) and in a low-inflation economy (developed economy). In an endowment economy, when inflation is reduced from 1.5% to zero in a developed economy, the welfare costs for agents with (without) financial access are 0.36% (1.1%) consumption equivalent variation (CEV). In a model with costly credit, the welfare costs for agents with (without) financial access are 0.7% (1.36%) CEV. For developing countries, when inflation is reduced from 6.2% to zero, the welfare costs for agents with (without) financial access are 1.3% (5%) in an endowment economy. In the costly-credit model, the welfare costs for agents with (without) financial access are 0.44% (6%) CEV. The main finding is that there is a substantial asymmetry in welfare costs between individuals with and without access to financial services, especially in developing countries.

Title:  How Substitutable are Fixed Factors in Production?  Evidence from Pre-industrial England
Abstract:  The extent to which fixed factors of production such as land constrain per-capita
income growth has been a widely discussed topic in economics since at least Malthus
(1798). Whether fixed factors limit growth depends crucially on two variables: the
substitutability of fixed factors in production, and the extent to which innovation will
be biased towards land-saving technologies. However, there are few estimates of either
variable, and most models assume this elasticity of substitution is unity out of con-
venience. This paper attempts to fill that gap in the literature. Using the timing of
plague epidemics as an instrument for labor supply, this paper estimates the elasticity
of substitution between fixed and non-fixed factors in pre-industrial England. I find
that the elasticity of substitution between land and other factors during this period
was signicantly less than one, which implies that the Malthusian effects of population
on income were stronger than current models predict. In addition, I am able to esti-
mate the direction and magnitude of induced innovation. I find evidence that denser
populations -- and hence higher land scarcity -- induced innovation towards land-saving
technologies. Specically, I find that a doubling of population density in England from
its year 1500 level raises the difference in the growth rates of land- and labor-enhancing
productivity by 0.22% per year.

Title:  Screening for a Chronic Disease: A Multiple Stage Duration Model with Partial Observability
Abstract:  This study develops a discrete multiple state duration model for screen-
ing a chronic disease that allows for duration dependence, unmeasured
heterogeneity, partial observability of the state and endogenous treat-
ment. We study whether screening for diabetes is e�ective in delaying
progression of complications of the lower extremities. Our results show
that early diagnoses of diabetes reduces the probabilities of transitioning
to a worse disease stage, death or amputation. In particular, decreasing
the time screening for the onset of diabetes from every four years to once a
year after age 65 saves: 54 lives, 10 amputations, and 89 lower extremity
complications of 10,000 individuals by age 80.

Title:  Individuals� Preventive Behavioral Response to Changes in Malaria Risks and Government Interventions: Evidence from six African countries
Abstract:  This paper analyzes the importance of malaria prevalence, malaria ecology, and indoor residual spraying on the probability of sleeping under an insecticide-treated net (ITN) in six African countries. Using individual data on ITN usage combined with the malaria prevalence and ecology data for the area where the person lives, we show that malaria prevalence and ecology have positive effects on ITN usage. However, ITN usage is inelastic with respect to malaria prevalence, with elasticity of 0.181 for children under 5 and of 0.223 for adult women. We also find that indoor residual spraying does not crowd out ITN usage.

Title:  The Effect of Density and Trip-Chaining on the Interaction between Urban Form and Transit Demand
Abstract:  Some urban policies are designed to reduce auto and increase transit usage. Evidence is mixed because most empirical research uses ad hoc specifications. We estimate empirical models of the interaction between urban form and transit demand drawn from urban economic theory. Population density has a small impact on transit demand, which decreases when residential location is endogenous. Households living farther from work use less transit, a result of trip-chaining. Reducing the spatial allocation of non-work activities, improving transit accessibility at and around subcenters, and increasing the presence of retail locations in proximity to transit-oriented households would increase transit demand.

Title:  Urban Firm Location and Land Use Under Certainty and Under Product-Price and Land-Rent Risk
Abstract:  This paper introduces risk into location and land-use choices of a profit-maximizing urban firm. Although risk has been introduced into the location theories of Von Th�nen, Weber, and Hotelling (Asami and Isard, 1989), it has not to our knowledge been incorporated into a firm�s choice of intraurban location and land use. We address this issue with a simple model of an urban firm, which chooses location (as distance from the CBD) and land input within an urban area. This model has antecedents in Aloa (1974), Moomaw (1980), and Cooke (1983) but is both simpler (in that it includes only one input, land) and more general (in that it assumes general functional forms and profit maximization). We start with choices under certainty, providing comparative static results on location and land use for changes in product price and land rent. We find location and land use directly related to product price and inversely related to land rent. We then turn to choice of location and land use under product-price and land-rent risk. Both product-price and land-rent risk lead the firm to choose less land and a location closer to the CBD than under certainty. The appendix extends the model to a mean-preserving increase in risk.

Title:  Imperfect Evaluation in Project Screening
Abstract:  This paper studies a model in which an agent considers proposing a project of
unknown quality to an evaluator, who has to decide on whether or not to accept it.
Earlier papers considered the case when the evaluation is perfect and showed than
higher submission fees increase the expected quality of projects submitted for review
by discouraging long-shot submissions. We examine the case of two-sided incomplete
information where not only the agent's, but also the evaluator's assessment of the
project is imperfect. We show that under this specifcation, an increase in the submis-
sion fee may lead to a decrease in the quality of projects that are implemented because
of its adverse effects on the evaluator's acceptance policy.

Title:  Information Acquisition and Innovation under Competitive Pressure
Abstract: This paper studies information acquisition under competitive pressure and proposes a model
to examine the relationship between product market competition and the level of innovative ac-
tivity in an industry. Our paper offers theoretical support for recent empirical results that point
to an inverted-U shape relationship between competition and innovation. The model presents
an optimal timing decision problem where a firm endowed with an idea trades the benefits of
waiting for additional information on whether this idea can be converted into a successful project
against the cost of delaying innovation: a given firm's profit following innovation is decreasing
in the number of firms that invested at earlier dates. By recognizing that a firm can intensify its
innovative activity on two dimensions, a risk dimension and a quantitative dimension, we show
that firms solve this trade-off precisely so as to generate the inverted-U shape relationship.

Title:  The Impact of a Public Option in the Health Insurance Market
Abstract: We develop a framework where to examine the implications of the introduction of a non-
profit "public option" in the U.S. health insurance market. In this model, a continuum of
heterogeneous consumers, each facing unknown medical expenditures, and differing in their
expectations of such expenditures, have to choose between two competing plans. One plan is
offered by a profit-maximizing private insurer; the other by social-welfare-maximizing public
option. The model is calibrated based on data of U.S. medical expenditures and estimation
of a Bayesian hierarchical model. The Nash Equilibrium of the resulting market structure is
solved using a numerical algorithm. In equilibrium, the distinct objectives of the two insurers
induce adverse selection in consumer choice: the public option covers the less healthy consumers,
yielding the more profitable segment of market to the private insurer. However, our empirical
results suggest that both insurers will capture significant parts of the health insurance market.

Title:  Project Screening with Tiered Evaluation
Abstract: We study a Bayesian game of two-sided incomplete information in which an agent, who
owns a project of unknown quality, considers proposing it to an evaluator, who has the choice of
whether or not to accept it. There exist two distinct tiers of evaluation that differ in the benefits
they deliver to the agent upon acceptance of a project. The agent has to select the tier to which
the project is submitted for review. Making a proposal incurs a cost on the agent in the form
of a submission fee. We examine the effect of a change in the submission fees at the two tiers of
evaluation on the expected quality of projects that are implemented by the evaluator.

Title:  Strategic Clustering and Competition by Alcohol Retailers: An Emperical Anlysis of Entry and Location Decisions
Abstract: We develop and estimate a spatial game-theoretic model of entry and location choices to examine firms� strategic clustering decisions. The model identifies two contradictory effects that determine firms� geographical location choices: a competition effect and a clustering effect. We also separate firms� strategic clustering incentives from the observed clustering behavior due to exogenous factors such as population and topographic desirability or constraints. In particular, we examine two closely related industries that share similar location limitations but have different strategic incentives to cluster, jointly estimate the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of a two-industry entry and location game, and quantify the strategic clustering incentives.

Title:  The (Non) Equivalence of Tariff and Quota Policy in the Presence of Search Costs
Abstract: This study compares the economic effects of tariffs and quotas in an environment where exporters must expend resources to find foreign consumers. Within a sequential search model, we find the policies to be (with rare exceptions) nonequivalent in domestic price. The relative impact of the two policies on domestic prices depends crucially on the magnitude of the two policies with prices more likely to be higher under tariff policy at lower tariff rates. The study adds to the �equivalence� literature by identifying another, and empirically relevant, factor which would result in the breakdown of equivalence between tariff and quota policy.

Title:  The Analytics of Export Promotion Policies Designed to Reduce Search Costs
Abstract: This study examines the economic effects of export subsidy policy in an environment where exporters must expend resources to find foreign consumers. Within a sequential search model we find that export promotion policies specifically designed to lower an exporter�s search costs (e.g., government-sponsored trade missions) have very different effects than non-targeted subsidies. For example, subsidies that lower search costs induce exporters to increase their price. However, this result is sensitive to model specification and may even be reversed when the analysis allows for foreign competition.

Title:  Interdependent Voting in Two-Candidate Voting Games
Abstract: The election of a political candidate is a public good for all those who prefer it and a public bad for those who are opposed. Given free-rider problems and other features of collective action, the probability that any one voter will vote for a preferred candidate is unlikely to be independent of the voting probabilities of all others with the same electoral preference, as is so often assumed. Interdependent voting probabilities are, therefore, likely to be the norm rather than the exception. We make no assumption about this interdependence other than a generalized concavity condition.
The point of departure for this paper is independent voting in the context of a two-candidate, regular concave voting game. Such games always have a unique, asymptotically stable equilibrium platform. This platform is not the ideal point of the median voter, however. It is also, in general, not Pareto optimal. With interdependent voting, the unique equilibrium is preserved when candidates have the same initial endowments. If one candidate is advantaged (so the game is not symmetrical), however, plurality-maximizing candidates will cycle endlessly.
A candidate advantage creates a convex set of platform choices, none of which can be defeated by the disadvantaged opponent. An equilibrium without convergence is achieved if we assume that the advantaged candidate chooses from an undefeatable set a platform that maximizes utility while an opponent maximizes her plurality. The set of undefeatable platforms collapses on a unique winning platform as the advantage disappears.

Title:  Asymmetric Information in Wage Negotiations: Hockey's Natural Experiment
Abstract: This research develops a model of wage negotiation and tests several implications for wages when information asymmetries that favor employers are reduced. The model predicts that given sufficient time to adjust: 1) wages, and labor�s share of the distribution of earnings, will increase; 2) labor�s job performance will become a more important determinant of wages; and 3) the personalities of wage negotiators will become less important. The empirical setting is professional hockey. Beginning in 1989 the National Hockey League Players� Association began annually to reveal the salaries of all its members. Over the next five seasons as contracts were renegotiated wages rose precipitously. Over the same period the role of player performance in determining wages gained importance while the identity of the team with which they negotiated lost all significance.

Title:  Theory of the Urban Firm: A Revival?
Abstract: The theory of the urban firm has been moribund for thirty years. We believe this is due to the perception that the theory cannot generate testable hypotheses. In fact, the theory yields unambiguous comparative static results. We find location and land use directly related to product price and inversely related to land rent. The theory is also amenable to risk analysis. We show that both product-price and land-rent risk lead the firm to choose less land and a location closer to the CBD than under certainty. We hope that our contribution rekindles interest in the theory of the urban firm.

Title:  Determinants of Urban Sprawl: A Panel Data Approach
Abstract: This paper employs panel-data estimation approaches to test hypotheses of the monocentric urban model.  We apply both within- and between- groups estimation approaches to urbanized area data for the 1990-2010 period.  From a fixed-effects (within-groups) model, we find that a 1-percent increase in population or a 1-percent decrease in travel costs expands the urbanized area by 1.05 percent or 0.52 percent, respectively.  The impact of household income on urban spatial size is negative, contrary to the theoretical prediction.  Similar findings of the impact of population and travel costs are obtained from the between-groups estimation.  While the impact of household income is negative in the fixed effect-model, its impact is ambiguous in the between-groups estimation.  The between-groups estimation also indicates that geographic and political factors help explain spatial size differences across urbanized areas.  Spatial size is larger with a higher percentage of the urban fringe overlying aquifers, a higher percentage of local revenues from intergovernmental transfers, a lower elevation range in the urban fringe, and a lower number of restaurants and bars per 1000 people.

Title:  Another View of Sprawl from Space
Abstract: Burchfield, et al., �Causes of Sprawl: A Portrait from Space,� Quarterly Journal of Economics, CXXI (2006), 587�633, show that variables chosen from the monocentric model and its generalizations as well as those capturing geographical and political characteristics of urban areas are important in explaining urban sprawl, as measured by an index of the amount of undeveloped land around an average dwelling. Although Burchfield, et al., draw on the urban monocentric model and its extensions, they do not, with one exception, employ the exogenous variables of that model. On the other hand, with one recent exception, urban economists do not use geographical and political characteristics to explain sprawl, defined as the spatial size of the urban area. We were interested, therefore, in seeing if combining these two sets of variables better explains these two measures of sprawl. The main findings of this paper are (1) the standard monocentric model variables fail to contribute to an explanation of the sprawl index, (2) these variables are, however, very important in explaining the spatial size of urban areas, and (3) the Burchfield, et al., variables contribute to an explanation of the spatial size of urban areas. We conclude with a summary and some comments on the role of theory in providing empirically testable hypotheses. We call for efforts to develop a theory comparable to the monocentric model to explain the Burchfield, et al. (2006), measure of sprawl.

Title:  An Empirical Analysis of Determinants of Multi-Dimensional Urban Sprawl
Abstract: This paper applies a simultaneous equation model to examine the impact of a variety of factors on four dimensions of urban sprawl: spatial size, sprawl index, and daily vehicle miles traveled per capita. The regression results indicate that the transportation cost has a negative impact on urban sprawl in terms of spatial size, land consumption per capita and daily VMT. The impact of household income on spatial size, land consumption per capita and daily vehicle miles traveled per capita are U-shaped. The impact of number of household is mixed: it has a positive impact on spatial size and daily VMT, but a negative impact on land consumption per capita. Urban growth boundary has a negative and statistically significant impact while minimum lot size has a positive impact on two dimensions of urban sprawl (spatial size and land consumption per capita). Regression results also indicate that among the variables that capture the political, social and geographic characteristics of an area, the amount of intergovernmental transfers as a percentage of local revenue has a positive and statistically impact on all four dimensions of urban sprawl while the percentage of urban fringe area overlying aquifers has such an impact on three dimensions (spatial size of an area, sprawl index, and land consumption per capita). The violent crime rate in the central cities has a positive and statistically significant impact on two dimensions of urban sprawl (spatial size and land consumption per capita).

Title:  Civil Conflict, Sex Ratio and Intimate Partner Violence in Rwanda
Abstract: This paper examines the long-term impact of civil conflict on intimate partner violence and women's decision-making power using post-genocide data from Rwanda.  Household survey data collected 11 years after the genocide indicate that women who became married after the genocide experience significantly increase intimate partner violence and decreased decision-making power relative to women who became married before.  The effect was greater for women in localities with high genocide intensity.  I find that variation in the marriage market ratio across localities and over time explain part of the effect of the genocide on intimate partner violence.

Title:  Multiproduct Firms, Product Scope and Productivity: Evidence from India�s Product Reservation Policy 
Abstract: We provide novel evidence showing product scope dynamics within a firm is an important dimension of productivity growth. This channel is identified by leveraging the gradual dismantling of an Indian regulation that �reserved� hundreds of products for manufacture in the small-scale sector. Following the removal of these product market restrictions, product churning and productivity rose. Multiproduct firms who were never in the reserved sector drive this increase, suggesting that the reservation policy constrained their ability to achieve the optimal product mix. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating heterogeneity at the product-firm level in assessing the impact of size-contingent regulation.

Title:  The Signaling Role of Not Being Promoted: Theory and Evidence
Abstract: This article studies the negative signals associated with non-promotion. I first show theoretically that, when workers� productivity rises little with additional years on the same job level, the negative signal associated with non-promotion leads to wage decreases. On the other hand, when additional job-level tenure leads to a sizable increase in productivity, workers� wages increase. I test my model�s predictions using the personnel records from a large US firm from 1970-1988. I find a clear hump-shaped wage-job-tenure profile for workers who stay in the same job level, which supports my model�s prediction.

Title:  Flattening Firms and Wage Distribution
Abstract: This article studies the consequences of firm delayering on wages and the wage distribution inside firms. I consider a job-assignment model with asymmetric information and a slot constraint. The model predicts that more efficient firms are not necessarily larger than less efficient firms if firms are allowed to adjust their internal organizational structure through delayering. After delayering, wages at all levels increase and the wage distribution becomes more unequal. These predictions match a set of empirical findings in recent studies that are not well explained by existing theories.

Title:  Heat Waves at Conception and Later Life Outcomes 
Abstract: This paper explores whether heat waves at conception, while in utero, or after birth cause better educational and health outcomes as adults. Using Census and DHS data from sub-Saharan Africa, we show that individuals conceived during heat waves have higher educational attainment and literacy, fewer disabilities, and lower child mortality. However, we find no effect of temperature at other times in utero.  We then explore several channels through which this effect may occur, including heat-induced changes in sexual behavior, differences in parental characteristics, and intensified fetal selection.  We show that fetal selection is the most likely mechanism driving our result.

Title:  Assisted Reproductive Technology and Women�s Choice to Pursue Professional Careers
Abstract: We examine the impact of assisted reproductive technology on women�s choice to pursue professional careers. We hypothesize that the availability of assisted reproductive technology increases the expected benefits of a professional degree by allowing women to delay childbearing in their 20s and 30s while establishing their careers, thereby reaping greater financial benefit from human capital investment. We exploit the state and time level variation in the enactment of insurance mandates to cover infertility treatments in employer sponsored health plans, as well as cohort variation in women�s age at the time the laws are passed. These insurance mandates dramatically increase access to assisted reproductive technology. Using a triple-difference strategy, we find that a mandate to cover assisted reproductive technology does increase the probability that a woman chooses to invest in a professional degree and to work in a professional career.

Title:  Optimal Contracts with Random Auditing
Abstract: In this paper we study an optimal contract problem under moral hazard in a principal-agent framework where contracts are implemented through random auditing. This monitoring instrument reveals the precise action taken by the agent with some nondegenerate probability r, and otherwise reveals no information. We characterize optimal contracts with random perfect monitoring under several information structures that allow for moral hazard and adverse selection. We evaluate the effect of the intensity of monitoring, as measured by r, on the value of the optimal contract. We show that more intense monitoring always increases the value of a contract when the principal can commit to make payments even if the an evaluation reveals that the agent took an action not allowed by the terms of the contract. When such commitment is infeasible and in equilibrium the agent shirks under some realizations of his type, the value of a contract may decrease in r.

Title:  A Simulation Model of the Effect of Fertility Reduction on Economic Growth in Africa
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a decline in fertility on economic growth and development outcomes using a macrosimulation model. We incorporate three fertility effects that have previously not been included in such models: the effect of fertility on child health and later worker productivity; the effect of fertility on savings; and a feedback mechanism from female education to fertility, in which changes in female education that are induced by declining fertility in turn alter subsequent fertility. We also improve the model of the economy by incorporating a more realistic three-sector framework and by allowing for labor market imperfections. Using data from Nigeria, we find that adding these channels roughly doubles the effect of an initial fertility decline on income per capita after 50 years when compared to previous simulation results.

Title: Malaria and Anemia among Children in sub-Saharan Africa: the Effect of Mosquito Net Distribution
Abstract: This article explores the impact of antimalarial campaigns, and in particular of the scale up in the distribution of mosquito nets, on anemia for children under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa. It uses individual-level data on more than 150,000 children and their families, combined with regionallevel data on malaria intensity before the antimalarial campaigns, for 16 countries between 2000 and 2014. Using a differences-in-differences estimation strategy, the paper tests whether the impact of the campaigns on anemia is larger in regions where the intensity of malaria was greater prior to the campaigns. The results indicate that the scale up has a negligible or small effect on moderate or severe anemia, whereas the other campaigns do not have any significant impact.

Title: A Structural Model of Advertising Signaling and Social Learning: The Case of the Motion Picture Industry
Abstract: This paper empirically studies how social learning among consumers shapes firms' optimal strategies of using advertising to signal product quality. I present an equilibrium model that describes both consumers and firms'learning and decision-making under quality uncertainty. My model allows me to distinguish between two roles of informative advertising reaching consumers and signaling product quality. I apply the model to the U.S. motion picture theatrical market where advertising and social learning are two main factors for a new movie's success. The structural estimates imply that movie studios signaling advertising only helps to reduce consumers' uncertainty by less than 10 percent. Word-of-mouth is a much more efficient learning channel for consumers, reducing their uncertainty by more than 90 percent. I also find that around 27 percent of advertising spending for movies in my sample is used for signaling product quality, while 73 percent is used for reaching consumers. Studios tendency to advertise more during the pre-release rather than the post-release weeks is explained to a large extent by the signaling purpose.

Title: Variety and Experience: Learning and Forgetting in the Use of Surgical Devices
Abstract: A tremendous variety of medical devices is available to surgeons today. In this environment, a surgeons ease in using a device version that he has never previously used has important implications for productivity and quality. Further, high device variety increases the time gap between repeat uses of any particular device version by a surgeon. This can result in forgetting over time of device-version-specific knowledge. The impact of forgetting over time at the level of specific tasks has not been examined previously. We use a unique, hand-collected dataset to examine learning and forgetting in hip replacement surgery as a function of a surgeon?s experience with specific surgical device versions and the time between their repeat uses. We also develop a generalizable method to correct for the left-censoring of device-version-specific experience variables that is a common problem in highly granular experience data, using Maximum Simulated Likelihood Estimation (MSLE) with simulation over unobservables conditional on observables. Even for experienced surgeons, the first use of certain device versions can result in about a 32.4% increase in surgery duration, hurting quality and productivity. Also, with the passage of time, surgeons forget knowledge gained about the use of certain devices. We discuss implications for practice.

Title: Dynamic Contracts with Random Monitoring
Abstract: In environments where a principal contracts with many agents who each execute numerous independent tasks, it is often infeasible to evaluate an agent'?s performance on all tasks. Incentives under moral hazard are instead provided by monitoring only a subset of randomly selected tasks. We characterize optimal dynamic contracts implemented with this type of random monitoring technology. We consider a stochastic environment where the agent?'s cost of effort varies over time, and analyze situations where this cost is public or private information. In an optimal contract, the terms the agent is promised when monitoring reveals compliance are as good as when no monitoring is performed, and for some cost types are better. These latter types receive a monitoring reward. We also elicit the dynamics of contract parameters over time. As time passes and the agent becomes richer, the monitoring reward decreases as the threat of forgoing the promised stream of future compensation provides sufficient incentives for compliance.

Title: The Autocratic Root of Social Distrust
Abstract: This paper presents evidence that autocratic culture adversely affects social trust and civic engagement. Using a measure of individuals� inherited autocratic culture from their country of origin, we find that individuals whose ancestors migrated from countries with higher autocracy levels are less likely to trust others or to vote in presidential elections in the U.S. The impact of autocratic culture on generalized trust can last for three generations while the impact on voting disappears after one generation. These findings are consistent across the U.S. and Europe and are not driven by selection into migration.

Title: Teaching the DiPasquale-Wheaton Model
Abstract: The DiPasquale-Wheaton (1992) model graphically determines rental price, asset price, newly constructed stock, and total stock in a real estate market. Despite its frequent use in academic research, few textbooks exposit the model. We conjecture this is due in part to the difficulty of deriving its comparative static results. We derive a supply curve that simplifies graphical analysis and perform a complete graphical comparative static analysis. Although the main objective of this paper is to encourage pedagogical usage of the model, an appendix provides a mathematical derivation of the comparative static results, which has not heretofore appeared in the literature.

Title: The Effect of Antimalarial Campaigns on Child Mortality and Fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa
Abstract: We examine to what extent recent declines in mortality and fertility in sub-Saharan Africa can be attributed to insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs). Exploiting the rapid increase in ITNs during the mid-2000s, we employ a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to identify the causal effect of ITNs on mortality and fertility. We show that ITNs reduced all-cause child mortality, but surprisingly increased total fertility rates in spite of reduced desire for children and increased contraceptive use.  We explain this paradox by showing evidence for an unexpected increase in fecundity and sexual activity due to the better health environment after the ITN distribution.

Title:  Determinants of Urban Sprawl: A Panel Data Approach
Abstract: This paper applies fixed effects (within-groups) and between-groups estimations to panel data to test hypotheses of the monocentric urban model with urbanized area data for the period 1990�2010. The paper examines the impact of population, household income, transportation cost, and land rent at the urban fringe on urbanized area spatial size. The fixed effects regression finds that a 1- percent increase in population and a 1- percent decrease in travel cost causes an urbanized area to expand by 1.087 percent and 0.127 percent, respectively. The impact of household income is non-linear. The regression results from the between-groups estimation indicate that geographic and political factors help explain the spatial size differences across urbanized areas. The spatial size of an urbanized area is larger with a higher percentage of the urban fringe overlying aquifers, a higher percentage of local revenues from intergovernmental transfers, a higher percentage of urban fringe incorporated in 1980, and a lower elevation range in the urban fringe.

Title:  Malaria Prevalence, Indoor Residual Spraying, and Insecticide Treated Net Usage in Sub-Saharan Africa
Abstract:  This paper examines the extent to which bed net usage is responsive to changes in malaria prevalence and whether indoor residual spraying crowds out bed net usage. We show that malaria prevalence increases the probability of sleeping under an insecticide treated net but the implied elasticities are below one. For children under five, a one percentage point increase in malaria prevalence increases the probability of sleeping under a bed net by 0.41 percentage point. We find that indoor residual spraying does not crowd out bed net usage. Instead, children under five who live in houses that were recently sprayed are 3.1 percentage points more likely to sleep under a bed net.
